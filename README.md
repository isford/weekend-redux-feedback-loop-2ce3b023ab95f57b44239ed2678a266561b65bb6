# Weekend Redux Feedback Loop

## Description

_Duration: 15 Hours_

This project took approximately 15 hours. I set out to create a page in REACT and REDUX that allowed items to be shared through reducers rather than props. And on the last page all information stored locally in reducers was posted to a SQL database.

### Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

## Installation

1. Fork and clone files from github
2. Once open run `npm install` in terminal
3. In terminal run `npm run server`
4. In a second terminal run `npm run client`
5. Navigate to `localhost:3000` to submit feedback on course material

## Usage
